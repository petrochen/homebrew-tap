  # `brioctl watch` agent. The CLI installs it under the same label (`make agent`), so zapping the app must not
  # remove the CLI's agent; the caveats tell the user to turn the app's own copy off before uninstalling. The same
  # goes for ~/.config/brioctl (the settings file) and ~/Library/Logs/brioctl.log, which the CLI shares.

  caveats <<~EOS
    brioctl.app is signed ad hoc and not notarized by Apple. Homebrew removes the quarantine attribute
    after installing it, so macOS opens it without the "unidentified developer" dialog. The source is
    public: https://github.com/petrochen/brioctl (make app builds the same bundle).

    The app lives in the menu bar (no Dock icon) and does not need camera permission.
    Open it once from /Applications; "Launch at login" is in its settings (gear icon).

    If you turn on "Re-apply settings automatically" in the app, its LaunchAgent runs the brioctl inside
    the app. Turn it off before "brew uninstall --cask brioctl-app", or the agent keeps starting a program
    that is gone. The command-line formula (brew install petrochen/tap/brioctl) can be installed next to
    the app; its brew services agent is then the one the app keeps its settings file up to date for.
